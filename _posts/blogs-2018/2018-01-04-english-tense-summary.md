summary: For a long time, I have a vague concept about the English tense, especially when talking to tense in english(All I know is Chinese names of those tenses). Today I google it and finally I have a much clearer ideas about them, 16 tenses in total.

### Simple past

The simple past is used for a single event in the past, for past habitual action, or for a past state:

> He took the money and ran.
    
> I visited them every day for a year. 

The simple past is often close in meaning to the present perfect. The simple past is used when the event is conceived as occurring at a particular time in the past, or during a period that ended in the past (i.e. it does not last up until the present time). This time frame may be explicitly stated, or implicit in the context (for example the past tense is often used when describing a sequence of past events).

### Past progressive

The past progressive or past continuous construction combines progressive aspect with past tense, and is formed using the past tense of be (was or were) with the present participle of the main verb. It indicates an action that was ongoing at the past time being considered:

> At three o&#8217;clock yesterday, I was working in the garden.
    
> While I was washing the dishes, I heard a loud noise.
    
> While you were washing the dishes, Sue was walking the dog.
    
> (Interrupted actions in the past can also sometimes be denoted using the past perfect progressive, as described below.) 

The past progressive can also be used to refer to past action that occurred over a range of time and is viewed as an ongoing situation:

> I was working in the garden all day yesterday. 

That could also be expressed using the simple past, as I worked&#8230;, which implies that the action is viewed as a unitary event (although the effective meaning is not very different).

The past progressive shares certain special uses with other past tense constructions; see Conditional sentences § Notes, § Dependent clauses, Expressions of wish § Notes, and § Indirect speech.

### Past perfect

The past perfect, sometimes called the pluperfect, combines past tense with perfect aspect; it is formed by combining had (the past tense of the auxiliary have) with the past participle of the main verb. It is used when referring to an event that took place prior to the time frame being considered.[7] This time frame may be stated explicitly, as a stated time or the time of another past action:

> We had finished the job by 2 o&#8217;clock.
    
> He had already left when we arrived. 

Note that unlike the present perfect, the past perfect can readily be used with an adverb specifying a past time frame for the occurrence. For example, while it is incorrect to say *I have done it last Friday (the use of last Friday, specifying the past time, would require the simple past rather than the present perfect), there is no such objection to a sentence like &#8220;I had done it the previous Friday&#8221;.

The past perfect can also be used for states or repeated occurrences pertaining over a period up to a time in the past, particularly in stating &#8220;for how long&#8221; or since when&#8221;. However, if the state is temporary and the verb can be used in the progressive aspect, the past perfect progressive would normally be used instead. Some examples with the plain past perfect:

> I had lived in that house for 10 years. 

### Past perfect progressive

The past perfect progressive or past perfect continuous (also known as the pluperfect progressive or pluperfect continuous) combines perfect progressive aspect with past tense. It is formed by combining had (the past tense of auxiliary have), been (the past participle of be), and the present participle of the main verb.

Uses of the past perfect progressive are analogous to those of the present perfect progressive, except that the point of reference is in the past. For example:

> I was tired because I had been running.
    
> By yesterday morning they had already been working for twelve hours. 

This form is sometimes used for actions in the past that were interrupted by some event\[9\] (compare the use of the past progressive as given above). For example:

> I had been working on my novel when she entered the room to talk to me. 

The past perfect progressive may also have additional specific uses similar to those of the plain past perfect; see Conditional sentences § Notes, § Dependent clauses, Expressions of wish § Notes, and § Indirect speech.

### Simple present

Main article: Simple present
  
The simple present or present simple is a form that combines present tense with &#8220;simple&#8221; (neither perfect nor progressive) aspect. In the indicative mood it consists of the base form of the verb, or the -s form when the subject is third-person singular (the verb be uses the forms am, is, are). However, with nonauxiliary verbs it also has a periphrastic form consisting of do (or third-person singular does) with the bare infinitive of the main verb — this form is used in questions (and other clauses requiring inversion) and negations, and sometimes for emphasis. For details of this, see do-support.

The principal uses of the simple present are given below. More examples can be found in the article Simple present.

To refer to an action or event that takes place habitually. Such uses are often accompanied by frequency adverbs and adverbial phrases such as always, often, from time to time and never. Examples:

> I always take a shower.
    
> He writes for a living. 

This contrasts with the present progressive, which is used for actions taking place at the present moment.
  
With stative verbs in senses that do not use progressive aspect, to refer to a present or general state, whether temporary, permanent or habitual. (In senses that do use progressive aspect, the present simple is used when the state is permanent or habitual.)

> You are happy.
    
> I know what to do. 

### Present progressive

Main article: Present continuous
  
The present progressive or present continuous form combines present tense with progressive aspect. It thus refers to an action or event conceived of as having limited duration, taking place at the present time. It consists of a form of the simple present of be together with the present participle of the main verb and the ending -ing.

> We are cooking dinner now. 

This often contrasts with the simple present, which expresses repeated or habitual action (We cook dinner every day). However, sometimes the present continuous is used with always, generally to express annoyance about a habitual action:

You are always making a mess in the study.
  
Certain stative verbs do not use the progressive aspect, so the present simple is used instead in those cases (see § Progressive aspect above).

The present progressive can be used to refer to a planned future event:

> We are tidying the attic tomorrow. 

### Present perfect

The present perfect (traditionally called simply the perfect) combines present tense with perfect aspect, denoting the present state of an action&#8217;s being completed, that is, that the action took place before the present time. (It is thus often close in meaning to the simple past tense, although the two are not usually interchangeable.) It is formed with the present tense of the auxiliary have (namely have or has) and the past participle of the main verb.

The choice of present perfect or past tense depends on the frame of reference (period or point in time) in which the event is conceived as occurring. If the frame of reference extends to the present time, the present perfect is used. For example:

> I have written a letter this morning. (if it is still the morning)
    
> He has produced ten plays. (if he is still alive and professionally active) 

With already or yet, traditional usage calls for the present perfect: Have you eaten yet? Yes, I&#8217;ve already eaten. However, current informal American speech tends to use the simple past: Did you eat yet? Yes, I ate already.

Use of the present perfect often draws attention to the present consequences of the past action or event, as opposed to its actual occurrence.\[10] The sentence she has come probably means she is here now, while the simple past she came does not.[13] The sentence, “Have you been to the fair?” suggests that the fair is still going on, while the sentence, “Did you go to the fair?” could mean that the fair is over.[14\] (See also been and gone below.) Some more examples:

> I have eaten. (implies that I&#8217;m no longer hungry)
    
> We have made the dinner. (implies that the dinner is now ready to eat) 

### Present perfect progressive

The present perfect progressive (or present perfect continuous) construction combines some of this perfect progressive aspect with present tense. It is formed with the present tense of have (have or has), the past participle of be (been), and the present participle of the main verb and the ending ″-ing″

This construction is used for ongoing action in the past that continues right up to the present or has recently finished:

> I have been writing this paper all morning.
    
> Why are his eyes red? He has been crying. 

It is frequently used when stating for how long, or since when, something is the case:

> She has been working here since 1997.
    
> They have been arguing about it for two weeks. 

In these sentences the actions are still continuing, but it is the past portion of them that is being considered, and so the perfect aspect is used. (A sentence without perfect aspect, such as I am sitting here for three hours, implies an intention to perform the action for that length of time.) With stative verbs that are not used in the progressive, and for situations that are considered permanent, the present perfect (nonprogressive) is used instead; for examples of this see § Present perfect above.

### Simple future

The term simple future, future simple or future indefinite, as applied to English, generally refers to the combination of the modal auxiliary verb will with the bare infinitive of the main verb. Sometimes (particularly in more formal or old-fashioned English) shall is preferred to will when the subject is first person (I or we); see shall and will for details. The auxiliary is often contracted to &#8216;ll; see English auxiliaries and contractions.

This construction can be used to indicate what the speaker views as facts about the future, including confident predictions:

> The sun will rise tomorrow at 6:14.
    
> It will rain later this week. 

The modal verbs will and shall also have other uses besides indicating future time reference. For example:

> I will pass this exam. (often expresses determination in addition to futurity)
    
> You will obey me! (insistence)
    
> I will not do it! (negative insistence, refusal)
> 
> At this moment I will tolerate no dissent. (strong volition)
    
> He hasn&#8217;t eaten all day; he will be hungry now. (confident speculation about the present)
> 
> One of his faults is that he will make trouble unnecessarily. (habit)
    
> Shall we get to work? (suggestion) 

For more examples see will and shall in the article on modal verbs, and the article shall and will.

### Future progressive

The future progressive or future continuous combines progressive aspect with future time reference; it is formed with the auxiliary will (or shall in the first person; see shall and will), the bare infinitive be, and the present participle of the main verb. It is used mainly to indicate that an event will be in progress at a particular point in the future:

> This time tomorrow I will be taking my driving test.
    
> I imagine we will already be eating when you arrive. 

The usual restrictions apply, on the use both of the future and of the progressive: simple rather than progressive aspect is used with some stative verbs (see Progressive aspect § Notes), and present rather than future constructions are used in many dependent clauses (see § Conditional sentences and § Dependent clauses below).

The same construction may occur when will or shall is given one of its other uses (as described under § Future simple), for example:

> He will be sitting in his study at this time. (confident speculation about the present) 

### Future perfect

The future perfect combines § perfect aspect with future time reference. It consists of the auxiliary will (or sometimes shall in the first person, as above), the bare infinitive have, and the past participle of the main verb. It indicates an action that is to be completed sometime prior to a future time of perspective, or an ongoing action continuing up to a future time of perspective (compare uses of the present perfect above).

> I shall have finished my essay by Thursday.
    
> When I finally search him he will have disposed of the evidence.
    
> By next year we will have lived in this house for half a century. 

For the use of the present tense rather than future constructions in certain dependent clauses, see Conditional sentences § Notes and § Dependent clauses below.

The same construction may occur when will or shall is given one of its other meanings (see under § Simple future); for example:

> He will have had his tea by now. (confident speculation about the present)
    
> You will have completed this task by the time I return, is that understood? (giving instruction) 

### Future perfect progressive

The future perfect progressive or future perfect continuous combines perfect progressive aspect with future time reference. It is formed by combining the auxiliary will (or sometimes shall, as above), the bare infinitive have, the past participle been, and the present participle of the main verb.

Uses of the future perfect progressive are analogous to those of the present perfect progressive, except that the point of reference is in the future. For example:

> He will be very tired because he will have been working all morning.
    
> By 6 o&#8217;clock we will have been drinking for ten hours. 

For the use of present tense in place of future constructions in certain dependent clauses, see Conditional sentences § Notes and § Dependent clauses below.

The same construction may occur when the auxiliary (usually will) has one of its other meanings, particularly expressing a confident assumption about the present:

> No chance of finding him sober now; he&#8217;ll have been drinking all day. 

### Simple conditional

The simple conditional or conditional simple, also called conditional present, and in some meanings future-in-the-past simple, is formed by combining the modal auxiliary would with the bare infinitive of the main verb. Sometimes (particularly in formal or old-fashioned English) should is used in place of would when the subject is first person (I or we), in the same way that shall may replace will in such instances; see shall and will. The auxiliary is often shortened to &#8216;d; see English auxiliaries and contractions.

The simple conditional is used principally in a main clause accompanied by an implicit or explicit condition (if-clause). (This is described in more detail in the article on English conditional sentences; see also § Conditional sentences below.) The time referred to may be (hypothetical) present or future. For example:

> I would go tomorrow (if she asked me).
    
> If I were you, I would see a doctor.
    
> If she had bought those shares, she would be rich now. 

In some varieties of English, would (or &#8216;d) is also regularly used in the if-clauses themselves (If you&#8217;d leave now, you&#8217;d be on time), but this is often considered nonstandard. This is widespread especially in spoken American English in all registers, though not usually in more formal writing.[15] There are also situations where would is used in if-clauses in British English too, but these can usually be interpreted as a modal use of would (e.g. If you would listen to me once in a while, you might learn something).[16] For more details, see English conditional sentences § Use of will and would in condition clauses.

For the use of would after the verb wish and the expression if only, see § Expressions of wish.

The auxiliary verbs could and might can also be used to indicate the conditional mood, as in the following:

> If the opportunity were here, I could do the job. (= &#8230; I would be able to do &#8230; )
    
> If the opportunity were here, I might do the job. (= &#8230; maybe I would do &#8230;) 

Forms with would may also have &#8220;future-in-the-past&#8221; meaning:

> We moved into the cottage in 1958. We would live there for the next forty years. 

See also Indirect speech § Notes and § Dependent clauses. For other possible meanings of would and should (as well as could and might), see the relevant sections of English modal verbs.

### Conditional progressive

The conditional (present) progressive or conditional continuous combines conditional mood with progressive aspect. It combines would (or the contraction &#8216;d, or sometimes should in the first person, as above) with the bare infinitive be and the present participle of the main verb. It has similar uses to those of the simple conditional (above), but is used for ongoing actions or situations (usually hypothetical):

> Today she would be exercising if it were not for her injury.
    
> He wouldn&#8217;t be working today if he had been given the time off. 

It can also have future-in-the-past meanings:

> We didn&#8217;t know then that we would be waiting another three hours. 

For the use of would in condition clauses, see Simple conditional § Notes above (see also § Conditional sentences and Dependent clauses § Notes below). For use in indirect speech constructions, see § Indirect speech. For other uses of constructions with would and should, see English modal verbs. For general information on conditionals in English, see English conditional sentences (and also § Conditional sentences below).

### Conditional perfect

The conditional perfect construction combines conditional mood with perfect aspect, and consists of would (or the contraction &#8216;d, or sometimes should in the first person, as above), the bare infinitive have, and the past participle of the main verb. It is used to denote conditional situations attributed to past time, usually those that are or may be contrary to fact.

> I would have set an extra place if I had known you were coming.
    
> I would have set an extra place (but I didn&#8217;t because someone said you weren&#8217;t coming). (implicit condition) 

For the possibility of use of would in the condition clauses themselves, see Simple conditional § Notes (see also § Dependent clauses below). For more information on conditional constructions, see § Conditional sentences below, and the article English conditional sentences.

The same construction may have &#8220;future-in-the-past&#8221; meanings (see Indirect speech). For other meanings of would have and should have, see English modal verbs.

### Conditional perfect progressive

The conditional perfect progressive or conditional perfect continuous construction combines conditional mood with perfect progressive aspect. It consists of would (or sometimes should in the first person, as above) with the bare infinitive have, the past participle been and the present participle of the main verb. It generally refers to a conditional ongoing situation in hypothetical (usually counterfactual) past time:

> I would have been sitting on that seat if I hadn&#8217;t been late for the party. 

Similar considerations and alternative forms and meanings apply as noted in the above sections on other conditional constructions.
