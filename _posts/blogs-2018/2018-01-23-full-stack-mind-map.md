Mind map is becoming more and more popular these days. It helps us sort our ideas and inspirations, when we look at it, we will get a bigger and clearer picture of something. So I am gonna use this powerful tool to make a mind map of what should a full-stack programmer learn from my own perspective, or just say, what I expect myself to learn.

I spent a whole day to draw this mind map, however maybe it&#8217;s not complete enough to cover all aspects of full stack knowledge, but I think it has some reference value for you and I will extend this in the future.
