I picked up an astonishing news, that is the e-Residency of Estonia!

### What is it

> e-Residency of Estonia (also called virtual residency or E-residency) is a program launched by Estonia on 1 December 2014. The program allows non-Estonians access to Estonian services such as company formation, banking, payment processing, and taxation. The program gives the e-resident a smart card which they can use to sign documents. The program is aimed towards location-independent entrepreneurs such as software developers and writers. 

There are some chinese people having applied for this thing! It&#8217;s around 1,000 people so far according this data . To my surprise, I wonder what they have planned for to those people.

> 截止到目前，全球有 30964 名爱沙尼亚「电子公民」，中国人占 3.6%，男性占 88%。 

I will wait and see, but I have to admit, it has engaged my interest on this e-Residency. Maybe one day, I would apply for it when I figure out.
