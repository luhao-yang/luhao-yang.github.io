[前端开发指南：这里是2018年最值得关注的JavaScript趋势](http://36kr.com/p/5111090.html)

### 1.React vs. Vue.js

There are already many debates on them, I don&#8217;t talk more.

### 2.[Next.js](https://learnnextjs.com/)

> Next.js is a minimalistic framework for server-rendered React applications. 

What&#8217;s more, you can super fast deploy your app to cloud with [Now.js](https://zeit.co/now)

### 3.Angular2

I never have hooked up with Angular, and don&#8217;t have plans in the future.

### 4.[Reason](https://reasonml.github.io/)

> Reason lets you write simple, fast and quality type safe code while leveraging both the JavaScript & OCaml ecosystems. 

Facebook use Reason to develop web version of Messenger and other project like Whatsapp, Instagram, Ads etc.
  
They even introduced reason-react, with which it&#8217;s possible to code Reason into React js.

OCaml? My first reaction is that, what the hell is this?

Here is the official slogan of [OCaml](https://ocaml.org/).

> OCaml is an industrial strength programming language supporting functional, imperative and object-oriented styles 

### 5.[GraphQL](http://graphql.org/)

GraphQL is a query language for APIs and a runtime for fulfilling those queries with your existing data. GraphQL provides a complete and understandable description of the data in your API, gives clients the power to ask for exactly what they need and nothing more, makes it easier to evolve APIs over time, and enables powerful developer tools.

Redux、Relay Modern and Apollo is outstanding in various combinations. Some say GraphQL&#8217;s born has a singal of changing the situation of REST dominated field, does it?

### 6.Storybook

This project is totally popular in 2017, thanks to the React community, it spread widely and fast.

It&#8217;s fairly useful when specking of the component development, testing, and displaying.

### 7.Prettier

Prettier is an opinionated code formatter. It enforces a consistent style by parsing your code and re-printing it with its own rules that take the maximum line length into account, wrapping code when necessary.

I have it installed in my VScode in the form of plugins.

### 8.Jest and Enzyme

[Jest](https://facebook.github.io/jest/) is no doubt the leading one, and Enzyme have well supplmented to the testing.

### 9.Webpack

There is no need to go into details, everyone knows it, but few people master it.

### 10.Parcel

The thing is that the bundle speed of Parcel is much more faster than Webpack, because it&#8217;s light and easy to learn.

### 11.Gatsby

Gatsby lets you build blazing-fast sites with your data, whatever the source. Liberate your sites from legacy CMSs and fly into the future.

### 12.Babel

Everybody uses it in modern development.

### 13.Flow & Typescript

There is still a fierce competition between them, although they won&#8217;t take place of the other in 2018. However, the question is whether the fackbook&#8217;s Reason will replace them.

### 14.[Immutable.js](https://facebook.github.io/immutable-js/)

If you had got to know the redux, you would know the purpose of this lib.

Immutable data cannot be changed once created, leading to much simpler application development, no defensive copying, and enabling advanced memoization and change detection techniques with simple logic. Persistent data presents a mutative API which does not update the data in-place, but instead always yields new updated data.

Immutable.js provides many Persistent Immutable data structures including: List, Stack, Map, OrderedMap, Set, OrderedSet and Record.

### 15.[Popmotion](https://popmotion.io/)

Popmotion is a 11.5kb (max) Swiss Army knife for animators and interaction developers, which is pretty cool.

### 16.[React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/) & [Electron](https://electronjs.org/)

React Native lets you build your mobile app with javascript, while Electron lets you develop your desktop app using javascript as well.

Electron users：Slack、Atom、Github Desktop and Discord.

React Native sers：Facebook、Instagram、Airbnb and UberEATS.
