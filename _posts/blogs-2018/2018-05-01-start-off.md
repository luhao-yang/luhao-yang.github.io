I am going to take a journey to Europe with my wife. First Spain, then France, Italy, and Malta the last.

So during this time, 2nd May to 3th June, I would not update my blog, just dive into the amazing vacation. To be honest with you, I never have such a long vacation before, as my former company only give us five days of annual holiday! That sounds crazy, doesn&#8217;t it?

At last, I hope we enjoy a beautiful and unforgettable trip! In addition, I will share our memorable experience on my website.
