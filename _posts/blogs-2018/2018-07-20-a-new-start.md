I haven&#8217;t update my blog for a couple of months because I was too busy. There were too many things to handle in the past couple of months, such as resigning and handing over work, applying work visa, moving and sorting things, etc.

Honestly, it&#8217;s a bit difficult to give up a stable and decent life for much uncertainty. But since I chose it, I would not complain or regret about doing it. Anyway, I am in New Zealand now. I chatted with a cool guy this morning then I guess I have more confidence right now. It feels great.

Although I am still very busy with finding a flat to rent and working on my resume to hunt for a suitable job, I believe my life will go on better and better. After settling down,

I would have plenty of time to study, make a lot of friends, and explore more funny things and of course, fantastic sceneries.

BTW, it seems my wife already made new friends who are attending the same course with her, oh, classmates. In fact, she is kind of social phobia, even she has better English speaking than me. I hope her will love them, I mean, everything.
