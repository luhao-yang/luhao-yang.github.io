Last year, I have read a article about javascript topics, from a tech savvy guy.

[Top JavaScript Frameworks & Topics to Learn in 2017](https://medium.com/javascript-scene/top-javascript-frameworks-topics-to-learn-in-2017-700a397b711)

This year, He wrote another blog analyzing and anticipating the top javascript tech to learn in 2018.

[Top JavaScript Libraries & Tech to Learn in 2018](https://medium.com/javascript-scene/top-javascript-libraries-tech-to-learn-in-2018-c38028e028e6)

I strongly suggest you to read them all, you can see his predicts are kind of accurate.

For a long time, I have not been learning javascript and web engineering systematically, and now I want to take it seriously and methodically learn them. So let&#8217;s list what I considered the most important and imperativeï¼š

  1. **ES6**: I have worked on it but only used a little of it. I am willing to use more upon my projects.
  2. **Functional programming**: I am still on the level of &#8220;knowing&#8221;, so I need to read more and dig deeper in this realm.
  3. **Builtin methods**: There continues to come out new methods on built-in objects and types, so go on keeping a close eyes on them.
  4. **TypeScript**: deserve a try. More and more people start to learn it.
  5. **IDE**: turning from sublime to vscode which has a very large amount of plugins and integrated funtions, besides it supports TS very well.
  6. **Webpack**: try to understand its complicated configurations and sometimes customized my own config.
  7. **node&npm**: using node to write some small applications, get used to all kinds of command of npm, including git I think.
  8. **Vue**: have learnt it not going further. Vue is much lightweight and has a shortest path to get familiar, compared with React and angular. It is much more popular than angular in China, following after React.
  9. **React**: That&#8217;s what I want to dedicate to with my full heart this year, including Redux and the mainstream tools and libraries around this ecosystem.
