### Why?

I&#8217;ve left my footsteps on several countries from across Europe to America, along the coast of southeast asia all the way down to Australasia. Although after the beginning of my professional years I may not have that much time, each year I&#8217;d still try to squeeze some time to relax, mostly abroad. Here arose the question: Why do people travel? Why do I travel?

To relax, for most of the time. No doubt this is the major reason for working employees especially those like me who don&#8217;t have long annual leaves. But one can solve this problem in other ways like playing video games or just hangging out around.

To see the difference. Probably. Staying in one place for too long can be boring and people naturally grow the desire to explore the exotic world. It&#8217;s true though people can still see how foreign countries are different from us through all kinds of media, such as TV program and news. Wouldn&#8217;t that be enough?

To feel the experience. That&#8217;s the point hit right through me. Yes it&#8217;s my desire to experience how people are living their life in other parts of the plannet. There&#8217;s a saying in China that the outter world is marvellous, the outter world is helpless. Hmm, I&#8217;d love to feel the helplessness. And that&#8217;s what I&#8217;ve done.

### How?

Avoid the so-called popular sites. Of course you&#8217;ve seen every officials yelling all kinds of ranking lists. _The Top 10 Places You Must See, You Only Call It A Life When You Visit Blahblahblah_. BORING! Why do I need somebody else to tell me how I **Should** feel?

Just imagine, you&#8217;ve read an essay recommending a place with lots of detailed description and photoes. You&#8217;ve decided to see it in person. You&#8217;ve traveled far just to arrive there. You&#8217;ve seen it, gorgeous. You&#8217;ve taken a photo exactly like that&#8217;s in the essay. You&#8217;ve done all the things the essays told you to. You&#8217;ve posted the photo and experience on your social media and got hundreds of likes. Good job. What else?

Nothing, you&#8217;re not experiencing with your own heart. What you&#8217;ve done is just repeating the guideline which would be exactly no different even if you&#8217;ve never been there. How about changing your mind a little bit and think twice, WHAT DO I REALLY WANT?

Sorry I don&#8217;t have an answer either. Travelling could be so private, all I&#8217;m clear about is that travelling is not about showing off in front of your friends, not about hurry and tiring road trip just to see all the famous spots. I&#8217;d lie down on the grass and hear birds singing, I&#8217;d walk along the soft beach and feel the water gently washed upon my feet, I&#8217;d climb the mountains and be surrounded by the florance of unfamiliar plants, I&#8217;d try what locals are doing and join them. Only by slowing down your pace and forget about introductions and suggestions from others can you see what&#8217;s really beneath.

Another discovery I found during my travel is that, the more you communicate with others, no matter locals or other tourists, the more thoughts you gain. The less you take photoes, the more images engrave to your mind. People are seemingly too fascinating about taking photoes but ignored the fun to chat with people, or should I say too afraid to start talking especially with foreigners. Well don&#8217;t be. We learnt English not to get a higher score in tests, what&#8217;s more important is that we use the language to communicate. Don&#8217;t have the order reversed.

### When?

Literally anytime. I know most of us are trapped by the hustle and bustle coming from work or family or all things that drag you back. It&#8217;s OK. As long as we change a bit about the attitude towards travelling, things would be completely different.
