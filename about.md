I am Luhao Yang. This is my story.

I grew up in Chengdu, China. There is a saying that Chengdu is a city where you don't want to leave once you came. 

Here is a brief introduction to my hometown. Chengdu city, as the capital of Sichuan province,  with about 15 million inhabitants, has now become one of the most important economic, financial, commercial, cultural, transportation, and communication centers in Western China.

Although I was born in an average family, my parents tried their best to offer me a good education. I spent 18 years living in Chengdu, then I went to Beijing for college. After having this splendid seven years of college life, I came back to my hometown and managed to find a satisfying job.

Then I met my love, a beautiful and smart girl. We fell into love quickly and established our own family. We love traveling and exploring different sights and cultures in the world. After we visited New Zealand at the end of 2017, we made a bold decision: Move to NZ! 

Migration is definitely a significant thing in one's life. Especially when we had already got stable and decent salaries in our city, it seemed more difficult for us to give up what we had. Like other most Chinese parents,  my mom and dad were always hoping that I could follow their desires which basically was, staying with them, to have some children, and finally to live an ordinary but happy life.

This isn't wrong at all. I hope I would end up with this result as well but in my own way. There are dozens of reasons for us to leave for New Zealand, and also dozens of reasons to stay in China. It is too hard to compare the pros and cons of both countries. Besides we don't know what the future is like,  nobody does. But in a word, we just prefer the lifestyle of kiwi, dreaming about the easy but fantastic life there. 

We live in Wellington now, as we planned before. There still requires a lot of efforts to settle down along with much uncertainty, but we have a strong faith in our heart to reach this goal.

Now it's time to provide an outline of my professional background.

I am a fullstack developer with 4-5 years of experience in building various scalable systems and responsive websites. My skills include HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, React, Redux, SASS/LESS, styled-components, Jest, Mocha/Chai, NPM, Webpack as well as mobile application development using React Native. Also, I am experienced with Node.js, Express, Koa, GraphQL, MongoDB, MySQL. On top of that, I have a strong passion for technology and always want to learn new and cool techs, hoping that I could keep improving my skills and pushing myself forward.
